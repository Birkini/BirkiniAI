# Birkini

**Birkini** is a decentralized data infrastructure protocol built for structured datasets and AI-native workflows.  
It enables verifiable, permissionless access to data streams—financial, scientific, demographic, and institutional—across storage, query, and replication layers.

This project provides core modules for verifiable data storage, query indexing, and real-time replication designed for integration with AI agents, analytics engines, and distributed compute.

---

## :: Core Objectives

- Replace centralized APIs with cryptographically verifiable data access
- Create a public, composable layer for AI to query real-world structured datasets
- Return control, attribution, and value flow to data creators and curators

---

## :: Architecture

Birkini consists of three key layers:

### `1. Birkini Drive`  
> Encrypted file storage with optional public indexing. Files are hashed, chunked, and stored on decentralized backends (IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave).

### `2. Replication Engine`  
> Syncs structured datasets across distributed compute and storage systems in real-time or batch. Supports agent-triggered replication.

### `3. Query & Provenance Layer`  
> Offers SQL-like access to datasets with embedded proof layers. All schema changes, insertions, and writes are signed and recorded.

## :: Key Features

- Structured data made queryable, composable, and transparent
- Built-in versioning, signatures, and audit trails
- Plug-and-play replication into inference or analytics pipelines
- Rust-native protocol logic, TypeScript SDKs, and API wrappers
- Future support for multi-agent read/write coordination and staking-based validation

---

## :: Tech Stack

- Rust (protocol logic, data hashing, streaming)
- TypeScript (CLI, SDK, client tooling)
- PostgreSQL-compatible schema abstraction
- IPFS / Filecoin / Arweave (pluggable storage backends)

---

## :: Status

> Birkini is currently in private development.  
> Initial testnet modules will be released incrementally under the `/src` directory.

Public roadmap and documentation coming soon
